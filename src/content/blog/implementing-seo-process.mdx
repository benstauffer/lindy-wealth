To implement this detailed SEO process into your website (especially if you're running something like Lindy Wealth), here's a simplified action plan that breaks down the 8 steps into concrete tasks, tools, and timelines — all tailored for a small firm with limited time but high standards.

## Phase 1: Technical & On-Page SEO (Days 1–7)

**Tasks:**

*   Install WP Rocket and Smush (if on WordPress) for speed optimization.
*   Create and submit a sitemap using YoastSEO or RankMath.
*   Clean up site structure (all content should be <4 clicks from homepage).
*   Use Google Pagespeed Insights and GTMetrix to identify speed issues.
*   Enable Gzip compression and lazy loading (WP Rocket does this).
*   Use next-gen image formats (WebP via Smush or TinyPNG + manual upload).

## Phase 2: Keyword Research & Planning (Days 8–14)

**Tasks:**

*   List your 3–5 top SEO competitors (search "financial planning LA" etc.).
*   Use SEMrush or Ahrefs to extract keywords from their top pages.
*   Organize into a spreadsheet with:
    *   Keyword
    *   Priority
    *   Monthly Search Volume
    *   Blog or Landing Page?
    *   Status (Not written → Published)
*   **Free tools:** Ubersuggest, Google Search Console (Performance tab), Keywords Everywhere (browser plugin)

## Phase 3: Build SEO Landing Pages (Days 15–21)

**Tasks:**

*   Choose high-intent keywords like: `financial planning for business owners`, `California tax strategy`, etc.
*   Clone your homepage or services page and rewrite for each keyword.
*   Optimize each page using Yoast/RankMath or SurferSEO.
*   **Placement:** Add landing pages to the footer or hidden under a dropdown in your nav bar.

## Phase 4: Write Blog Content That Ranks (Ongoing, 1x/week)

**Workflow:**

*   Use your keyword sheet to outline blog posts.
*   Structure with H1-H3 headers, cover topics your competitors miss.
*   Use Grammarly + Hemingway for clarity.
*   Internal link every blog to at least 3 others.

**Writing Ideas:**

*   "How to Use Monte Carlo Simulations for Retirement Planning"
*   "LLC vs S-Corp for California Business Owners"
*   "Why Simplicity Wins in Investing (Lindy Perspective)"

## Phase 5: Easy Link Building (Ongoing)

**Starter Strategies:**

*   **Content-based outreach:** Email 5–10 people per article who might link to it.
*   **Reddit & IndieHackers:** Post educational insights (e.g. tax tips for solopreneurs).
*   **Guest Posting:** Reach out to small business or LA startup blogs.

**Linkable Asset Ideas:**

*   California Business Tax Calendar (free PDF)
*   Monte Carlo Retirement Calculator (interactive tool)
*   "Lindy Wealth Planning Checklist" (Google Doc)

## Phase 6: Smart Interlinking (1x/month audit)

**Tools:** Screaming Frog + Google `site:lindywealth.com "keyword"` to find where to add internal links.

**Goal:** Every post should link to 5–10 others. Do a quarterly link pass to catch missed opportunities.

## Phase 7: Improve CTRs with Better Headlines (Monthly)

**Tools:** Google Search Console (Pages → CTR), spreadsheet to track headlines.

**Test Headlines Like:**

*   "How to Retire in California Without Guessing the Market"
*   "The $10K Tax Mistake Most Founders Make"

Track performance after 30 days. If CTR < benchmark, swap headline.

## Phase 8: Monitor + Iterate (Quarterly)

**Checklist:**

*   Top 10 pages → optimize for speed, SEO, content depth
*   Add internal links to newly published content
*   Audit backlinks (use Ahrefs or Moz)
*   Update old posts with new data, better intros, and new links
