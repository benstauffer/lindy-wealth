If you're starting a business in California, one of your first decisions is what kind of legal entity to use. This choice affects how much tax you'll pay, how much paperwork you'll deal with, and whether your personal assets are protected if things go wrong. It can also affect your ability to grow.

Here's a simple breakdown of the three main types: LLCs, S Corps, and C Corps. We'll focus on how they work in California, and where the rules are a bit more complex.

## Why Entity Choice Matters

*   **Taxes:** California charges a minimum $800 annual franchise tax for LLCs, S Corps, and C Corps. LLCs may also face a gross receipts fee if revenue exceeds $250,000.
*   **Liability:** LLCs and corporations offer personal asset protection if operated properly.
*   **Administration:** C Corps require the most formalities; LLCs are more flexible.
*   **Growth:** C Corps are better for outside investment; S Corps and LLCs have limits.

## LLC: Flexible and Simple

An LLC gives you liability protection and pass-through taxes.

In California:

*   $800 franchise tax
*   Extra fee if gross receipts are over $250,000
*   Annual form (568) + Statement of Information ($20)

Good if: You want something simple with protection. Not great if you're planning to raise money.

## S Corp: Tax Savings for Active Owners

An S Corp is a tax election, not a legal structure. It avoids double taxation by passing profits through to owners, who then report them on personal tax returns. But you also have to pay yourself a "reasonable salary" and run payroll.

In California:

*   $800 minimum tax or 1.5% of net income (whichever is higher)
*   Statement of Information ($25)
*   Must run payroll and file Form 100S

Good if: You own the business and work in it full-time. There's a chance to save on self-employment taxes, but you'll have more complexity.

## C Corp: Built for Growth

A C Corporation pays its own taxes and can keep profits in the business. If it pays dividends, those get taxed again. This is double taxation. But a C Corp can have unlimited shareholders and raise venture capital.

In California:

*   8.84% corporate tax
*   $800 franchise tax (waived year 1)
*   Statement of Information ($25)

Good if: You plan to raise money, scale fast, or issue stock options.

## Quick Cost Checklist (California)

*   $800 annual franchise tax (all entities)
*   LLC gross receipts fee ($900â€“$11,790 over $250K)
*   Filing fees: $20 (LLC), $25 (Corp/S Corp)

## Ask Yourself

*   Will I take outside investment?
*   Am I reinvesting or taking money out?
*   Do I need liability protection?
*   Can I handle (or outsource) admin and payroll?
