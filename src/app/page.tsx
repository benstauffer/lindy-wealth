                  Financial planning doesn't need to be complicated. Too often, the financial services industry creates complexity as a way to justify its existence. Complex products, expensive AUM fees, and active management don't lead to better outcomes.

                Good financial planning comes down to the fundamentals: get clear on your goals, save consistently, invest in diversified low-cost funds, adjust as tax laws change, protect against major risks, and plan intentionally for retirement and legacy.                   </p>

                I build plans around your goals, not market predictions. I use simple strategies unless complexity improves after-tax, after-fee results. I provide clear roadmaps, tax-focused planning, and discipline during volatility. Together, we'll review plans periodically and always question complexity.                  </p>
